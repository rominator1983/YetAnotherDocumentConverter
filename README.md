# Yet Another Document Converter
A docker container for converting Open XML documents to PDF, PDF/A.

Conversion is done with libre office and unoconv.

The docker container runs a grpc server to call the conversion

This project is a result of a freaky friday that took place at RUBICON IT https://www.rubicon.eu/.
